PART 1: INTRODUCTION
This project aims to create a C-based coffee vending machine simulator that mimics self- service coffee stations behavior. 
The program features a menu-driven interface, clearly defined operations, and enables users to place orders based on ingredients. 
Additionally, it allows administrators to manage payments and refill the machine when ingredients run low.

PART 2: DESIGN AND CORE FUNCTIONALITY
The coffee machine is implemented using C to ensure efficient performance, clear logic, and maintainability. 
The program uses several functions, each handling a specific task, promoting a modular approach. 
This ensures that the program remains well-organized and easy to maintain.

PART 3: FUNCTIONALITY AND USER EXPERIENCE
The process begins when the user selects a coffee option. The program checks if the required ingredients are sufficient. 
If the ingredients are available, the user is asked for confirmation, reducing accidental selections. 

PART 4: ERROR HANDLING AND IMPROVEMENTS
The program is designed with robust error handling to ensure smooth operation. 

Conclusion
This coffee machine simulator provides an effective way to manage coffee orders, ingredient levels, and financial tracking. 
Through a structured C program, it ensures both customer satisfaction and smooth operations for the operator. 
While the current implementation covers essential functionality, there are opportunities for further enhancements, such as GUI development and analytics integration.
